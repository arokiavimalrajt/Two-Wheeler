 We entered the Two Wheeler industry in 2008.  We’ve developed rapidly since then by</br>
 focusing on brand-building via new product development guided by consumer insights, strategic</br>
 partnerships, service orientation, and building scale.</br>
</br>
Within eight months of entering the industry, we launched a portfolio of PowerScooters to critical</br>
 acclaim in September 2009.   Less than a year later, our PowerScooters had captured a double digit market share.</br>
 In 2011 Mahindra became the first Indian two-wheeler manufacturer to enter the FIM MotoGPTM</br>
 World Motorcycle Racing Championship, showcasing our engineering and technology expertise on</br>
 a platform where the best in the world compete. We followed this up by entering the Indian motorcycle market in 2013.</br>
 We aim to grow into a major player in the Indian Two Wheeler industry with a robust presence in all product segments.
