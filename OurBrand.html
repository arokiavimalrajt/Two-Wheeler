<h1 >OurBrand</h1>
<p>
Since 1945, we’ve built our company around the core idea that people will succeed if </br>
they are just given the opportunity. Employees across the Group constantly challenge</br>
conventional thinking to create solutions that make a significant difference in the lives of our customers. </br>
 That’s why everything we build—be it a tractor, financial service, solar-powered lamp, </br>
or software—is designed to empower you to reach your potential.    
</p>
<p>
nternally, we follow three basic tenets—accepting no limits, thinking alternatively, and driving </br>
positive change in everything we do.  These brand pillars guide all our actions and business</br>
decisions from deciding whether or not to enter a new field or planning a portfolio of services.
</p>
<p>
Accepting No Limits
</br>
We accept no limits, and ask the same of everyone else. In return, we work relentlessly to provide the tools,</br>
 information, and inspiration for us to push past limitations and comfort zones.
